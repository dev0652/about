#About Me
Heelo, this is my personal portfolio website created to showcase all my projects and my web-development skill.

##Design
The design of this website was inspired by Windows Phone Metro interface which I have always found clean and attractive.

Project cards can be viewed either as a list (couldn't resist it since it is so characterisitic of the Metro style) or a gallery (because I also wanted tiles). 
COnsider this an attempt to have the best of both worlds.

##Technologies
As this website was supposed to be a SPA/landing at the beginning, I chose to go with vanilla JavaScript instead of React. 
My bunder of choice is Vite. 
I have used EmailJS library for the contact form.

##Features
Here are some of the features of this website:

###Keyboard-accessible and screenreader-friendly
- all controls are focusable and keyboard-accessible
- images have alts
- elements without text have proper aria-labels
- project cards in list mode have 'aria-expanded' attributes

###Images

- images have been de-retinized in four different sizes which are loaded using srcset and sizes attributes
